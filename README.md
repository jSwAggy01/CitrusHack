Goal: 

    Our team is focusing on the theme of the global community track. 
    
    Primarily, we would like to address the issue of physical health within a community by making an
    interactive interface for users of which will curate an exercise regimen based on their fitness
    level, wellness goals, and accessibility to equipment, by pulling from a database of exercises. 
    
    The exercises will be categorized based on the the type of movement, the equipment needed for the
    exercise, and of course the exercise itself. Each tab the user opens will have metadata about the
    category/exercise which includes: a description of the exercise, the fitness level advised to
    perform the exercise, etc (other metadata TBD).
